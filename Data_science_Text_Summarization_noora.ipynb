        "\n",
        "1. Extractive Summarization: In extractive summarization, the goal is to select a subset of existing sentences or phrases from the original text and construct a summary by extracting and reordering them. The extracted sentences are typically chosen based on their relevance and importance to the overall content. Extractive summarization methods do not generate new sentences; they directly extract and assemble sentences from the source text. Extractive summaries are often more interpretable because they are composed of sentences that already exist in the source text.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Abstractive Summarization: Abstractive summarization, on the other hand, involves generating a summary that may contain sentences or phrases that do not exist in the source text. Instead of merely selecting and reordering existing text, abstractive summarization systems use natural language generation techniques to create a concise and coherent summary that captures the essence of the source content. Abstractive summarization is more challenging because it requires a deeper understanding of the source text and the ability to generate human-like sentences."

        "\n",
        "When they reached the old man's shack the boy took the rolls of line in\n",

        "\"Very well, Manolin,\" the old man said.  \"I feel confident today.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"So do I,\" the boy said.  \"Now I must get your sardines and mine and\n",

        "to carry anything.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"We're different,\" the old man said.  \"I let you carry things when you\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Good luck old man.\"\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "Sometimes someone would speak in a boat.  But most of the boats were\n",
        "silent except for the dip of the oars.  They spread apart after they\n",
        "were out of the mouth of the harbour and each one headed for the part\n",
        "of the ocean where he hoped to find fish.  The old man knew he was\n",
        "going far out and he left the smell of the land behind and rowed out\n",
        "into the clean early morning smell of the ocean.  He saw the\n",
        "phosphorescence of the Gulf weed in the water as he rowed over the part\n",
        "of the ocean that the fishermen called the great well because there was\n",
        "a sudden deep of seven hundred fathoms where all sorts of fish\n",
        "congregated because of the swirl the current made against the steep\n",
        "walls of the floor of the ocean.  Here there were concentrations of\n",
        "shrimp and bait fish and sometimes schools of squid in the deepest\n",
        "holes and these rose close to the surface at night where all the\n",
        "wandering fish fed on them.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the dark the old man could feel the morning coming and as he rowed\n",
        "he heard the trembling sound as flying fish left the water and the\n",
        "hissing that their stiff set wings made as they soared away in the\n",
        "darkness.  He was very fond of flying fish as they were his principal\n",
        "friends on the ocean.  He was sorry for the birds, especially the small\n",
        "delicate dark terns that were always flying and looking and almost\n",
        "never finding, and he thought, \"The birds have a harder life than we do\n",
        "except for the robber birds and the heavy strong ones.  Why did they\n",
        "make birds so delicate and fine as those sea swallows when the ocean\n",
        "can be so cruel?  She is kind and very beautiful.  But she can be so\n",
        "cruel and it comes so suddenly and such birds that fly, dipping and\n",
        "hunting, with their small sad voices are made too delicately for the\n",
        "sea.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He always thought of the sea as _la mar_ which is what people call her\n",
        "in Spanish when they love her.  Sometimes those who love her say bad\n",
        "things of her but they are always said as though she were a woman.\n",
        "Some of the younger fishermen, those who used buoys as floats for their\n",
        "lines and had motorboats, bought when the shark livers had brought much\n",
        "money, spoke of her as _el mar_ which is masculine.  They spoke of her\n",
        "as a contestant or a place or even an enemy.  But the old man always\n",
        "thought of her as feminine and as something that gave or withheld great\n",
        "favours, and if she did wild or wicked things it was because she could\n",
        "not help them.  The moon affects her as it does a woman, he thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "He was rowing steadily and it was no effort for him since he kept well\n",
        "within his speed and the surface of the ocean was flat except for the\n",
        "occasional swirls of the current.  He was letting the current do a\n",
        "third of the work and as it started to be light he saw he was already\n",
        "further out than he had hoped to be at this hour.\n",
        "\n",
        "I worked the deep wells for a week and did nothing, he thought.  Today\n",
        "I'll work out where the schools of bonita and albacore are and maybe\n",
        "there will be a big one with them.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before it was really light he had his baits out and was drifting with\n",
        "the current.  One bait was down forty fathoms.  The second was at\n",
        "seventy-five and the third and fourth were down in the blue water at\n",
        "one hundred and one hundred and twenty-five fathoms.  Each bait hung\n",
        "head down with the shank of the hook inside the bait fish, tied and\n",
        "sewed solid and all the projecting part of the hook, the curve and the\n",
        "point, was covered with fresh sardines.  Each sardine was hooked\n",
        "through both eyes so that they made a half-garland on the projecting\n",
        "steel.  There was no part of the hook that a great fish could feel\n",
        "which was not sweet smelling and good tasting.\n",
        "\n",
        "The boy had given him two fresh small tunas, or albacores, which hung\n",
        "on the two deepest lines like plummets and, on the others, he had a big\n",
        "blue runner and a yellow jack that had been used before; but they were\n",
        "in good condition still and had the excellent sardines to give them\n",
        "scent and attractiveness.  Each line, as thick around as a big pencil,\n",
        "was looped onto a green-sapped stick so that any pull or touch on the\n",
        "bait would make the stick dip and each line had two forty-fathom coils\n",
        "which could be made fast to the other spare coils so that, if it were\n",
        "necessary, a fish could take out over three hundred fathoms of line.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now the man watched the dip of the three sticks over the side of the\n",
        "skiff and rowed gently to keep the lines straight up and down and at\n",
        "their proper depths.  It was quite light and any moment now the sun\n",
        "would rise.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sun rose thinly from the sea and the old man could see the other\n",
        "boats, low on the water and well in toward the shore, spread out across\n",
        "the current.  Then the sun was brighter and the glare came on the water\n",
        "and then, as it rose clear, the flat sea sent it back at his eyes so\n",
        "that it hurt sharply and he rowed without looking into it.  He looked\n",
        "down into the water and watched the lines that went straight down into\n",
        "the dark of the water.  He kept them straighter than anyone did, so\n",
        "that at each level in the darkness of the stream there would be a bait\n",
        "waiting exactly where he wished it to be for any fish that swam there.\n",
        "Others let them drift with the current and sometimes they were at sixty\n",
        "fathoms when the fishermen thought they were at a hundred.\n",
        "\n",
        "But, he thought, I keep them with precision.  Only I have no luck any\n",
        "more.  But who knows?  Maybe today.  Every day is a new day.  It is\n",
        "better to be lucky.  But I would rather be exact.  Then when luck comes\n",
        "you are ready.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sun was two hours higher now and it did not hurt his eyes so much\n",
        "to look into the east.  There were only three boats in sight now and\n",
        "they showed very low and far inshore.\n",
        "\n",
        "All my life the early sun has hurt my eyes, he thought.  Yet they are\n",
        "still good.  In the evening I can look straight into it without getting\n",
        "the blackness.  It has more force in the evening too.  But in the\n",
        "morning it is painful.\n",
        "\n",
        "Just then he saw a man-of-war bird with his long black wings circling\n",
        "in the sky ahead of him.  He made a quick drop, slanting down on his\n",
        "back-swept wings, and then circled again.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"He's got something,\" the old man said aloud.  \"He's not just looking.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He rowed slowly and steadily toward where the bird was circling.  He\n",
        "did not hurry and he kept his lines straight up and down.  But he\n",
        "crowded the current a little so that he was still fishing correctly\n",
        "though faster than he would have fished if he was not trying to use the\n",
        "bird.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bird went higher in the air and circled again, his wings\n",
        "motionless.  Then he dove suddenly and the old man saw flying fish\n",
        "spurt out of the water and sail desperately over the surface.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Dolphin,\" the old man said aloud.  \"Big dolphin.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He shipped his oars and brought a small line from under the bow.  It\n",
        "had a wire leader and a medium-sized hook and he baited it with one of\n",
        "the sardines.  He let it go over the side and then made it fast to a\n",
        "ring bolt in the stern.  Then he baited another line and left it coiled\n",
        "in the shade of the bow.  He went back to rowing and to watching the\n",
        "long-winged black bird who was working, now, low over the water.\n",
        "\n",
        "As he watched the bird dipped again slanting his wings for the dive and\n",
        "then swinging them wildly and ineffectually as he followed the flying\n",
        "fish.  The old man could see the slight bulge in the water that the big\n",
        "dolphin raised as they followed the escaping fish.  The dolphin were\n",
        "cutting through the water below the flight of the fish and would be in\n",
        "the water, driving at speed, when the fish dropped.  It is a big school\n",
        "of dolphin, he thought.  They are wide spread and the flying fish have\n",
        "little chance.  The bird has no chance.  The flying fish are too big\n",
        "for him and they go too fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "He watched the flying fish burst out again and again and the\n",
        "ineffectual movements of the bird.  That school has gotten away from\n",
        "me, he thought.  They are moving out too fast and too far.  But perhaps\n",
        "I will pick up a stray and perhaps my big fish is around them.  My big\n",
        "fish must be somewhere.\n",
        "\n",
        "The clouds over the land now rose like mountains and the coast was only\n",
        "a long green line with the gray blue hills behind it.  The water was a\n",
        "dark blue now, so dark that it was almost purple.  As he looked down\n",
        "into it he saw the red sifting of the plankton in the dark water and\n",
        "the strange light the sun made now.  He watched his lines to see them\n",
        "go straight down out of sight into the water and he was happy to see so\n",
        "much plankton because it meant fish.  The strange light the sun made in\n",
        "the water, now that the sun was higher, meant good weather and so did\n",
        "the shape of the clouds over the land.  But the bird was almost out of\n",
        "sight now and nothing showed on the surface of the water but some\n",

        "formalized, iridescent, gelatinous bladder of a Portuguese man-of-war\n",
        "floating close beside the boat.  It turned on its side and then righted\n",

        "filaments trailing a yard behind it in the water.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"_Agua mala_,\" the man said.  \"You whore.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "From where he swung lightly against his oars he looked down into the\n",
        "water and saw the tiny fish that were coloured like the trailing\n",

        "made as it drifted.  They were immune to its poison.  But men were not\n",
        "and when some of the filaments would catch on a line and rest there\n",

        "\n",
        "The iridescent bubbles were beautiful.  But they were the falsest thing\n",
        "in the sea and the old man loved to see the big sea turtles eating\n",
        "them.  The turtles saw them, approached them from the front, then shut\n",
        "their eyes so they were completely carapaced and ate them filaments and\n",
        "all.  The old man loved to see the turtles eat them and he loved to\n",

        "\n",
        "He had no mysticism about turtles although he had gone in turtle boats\n",
        "for many years.  He was sorry for them all, even the great trunk backs\n",
        "that were as long as the skiff and weighed a ton.  Most people are\n",
        "heartless about turtles because a turtle's heart will beat for hours\n",
        "after he has been cut up and butchered.  But the old man thought, I\n",
        "have such a heart too and my feet and hands are like theirs.  He ate\n",
        "the white eggs to give himself strength.  He ate them all through May\n",
        "to be strong in September and October for the truly big fish.\n",
        "\n",
        "He also drank a cup of shark liver oil each day from the big drum in\n",

        "Now the old man looked up and saw that the bird was circling again.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"He's found fish,\" he said aloud.  No flying fish broke the surface and\n",
        "there was no scattering of bait fish.  But as the old man watched, a\n",
        "small tuna rose in the air, turned and dropped head first into the\n",
        "water.  The tuna shone silver in the sun and after he had dropped back\n",
        "into the water another and another rose and they were jumping in all\n",

        "bait.  They were circling it and driving it.\n",
        "\n",
        "If they don't travel too fast I will get into them, the old man\n",
        "thought, and he watched the school working the water white and the bird\n",
        "now dropping and dipping into the bait fish that were forced to the\n",
        "surface in their panic.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"The bird is a great help,\" the old man said.  Just then the stern line\n",
        "came taut under his foot, where he had kept a loop of the line, and he\n",
        "dropped his oars and felt the weight of the small tuna's shivering pull\n",
        "as he held the line firm and commenced to haul it in.  The shivering\n",
        "increased as he pulled in and he could see the blue back of the fish in\n",
        "the water and the gold of his sides before he swung him over the side\n",
        "and into the boat.  He lay in the stern in the sun, compact and bullet\n",
        "shaped, his big, unintelligent eyes staring as he thumped his life out\n",
        "against the planking of the boat with the quick shivering strokes of\n",
        "his neat, fast-moving tail.  The old man hit him on the head for\n",
        "kindness and kicked him, his body still shuddering, under the shade of\n",
        "the stern.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Albacore,\" he said aloud.  \"He'll make a beautiful bait.  He'll weigh\n",
        "ten pounds.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He did not remember when he had first started to talk aloud when he was\n",
        "by himself.  He had sung when he was by himself in the old days and he\n",
        "had sung at night sometimes when he was alone steering on his watch in\n",
        "the smacks or in the turtle boats.  He had probably started to talk\n",
        "aloud, when alone, when the boy had left.  But he did not remember.\n",
        "When he and the boy fished together they usually spoke only when it was\n",
        "necessary.  They talked at night or when they were storm-bound by bad\n",
        "weather.  It was considered a virtue not to talk unnecessarily at sea\n",
        "and the old man had always considered it so and respected it.  But now\n",
        "he said his thoughts aloud many times since there was no one that they\n",

        "\n",
        "\"If the others heard me talking out loud they would think that I am\n",

        "big one around that school, he thought.  I picked up only a straggler\n",
        "from the albacore that were feeding.  But they are working far out and\n",
        "fast.  Everything that shows on the surface today travels very fast and\n",

        "in the water and he still held it, bracing himself against the thwart\n",

        "down on his knees and, being careful not to jerk on the line, moved as\n",
        "far into the bow as he could get and reached the water bottle with one\n",
        "hand.  He opened it and drank a little.  Then he rested against the\n",
        "bow.  He rested sitting on the un-stepped mast and sail and tried not\n",
        "to think but only to endure.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then he looked behind him and saw that no land was visible.  That makes\n",

        "Havana.  There are two more hours before the sun sets and maybe he will\n",
        "come up before that.  If he doesn't maybe he will come up with the\n",
        "moon.  If he does not do that maybe he will come up with the sunrise.\n",
        "I have no cramps and I feel strong.  It is he that has the hook in his\n",
        "mouth.  But what a fish to pull like that.  He must have his mouth shut\n",
        "tight on the wire.  I wish I could see him.  I wish I could see him\n",
        "only once to know what I have against me.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fish never changed his course nor his direction all that night as\n",
        "far as the man could tell from watching the stars.  It was cold after\n",
        "the sun went down and the old man's sweat dried cold on his back and\n",
        "his arms and his old legs.  During the day he had taken the sack that\n",
        "covered the bait box and spread it in the sun to dry.  After the sun\n",
        "went down he tied it around his neck so that it hung down over his back\n",
        "and he cautiously worked it down under the line that was across his\n",
        "shoulders now.  The sack cushioned the line and he had found a way of\n",
        "leaning forward against the bow so that he was almost comfortable.  The\n",
        "position actually was only somewhat less intolerable; but he thought of\n",
        "it as almost comfortable.\n",
        "\n",
        "I can do nothing with him and he can do nothing with me, he thought.\n",
        "Not as long as he keeps this up.\n",
        "\n",
        "Once he stood up and urinated over the side of the skiff and looked at\n",
        "the stars and checked his course.  The line showed like a\n",
        "phosphorescent streak in the water straight out from his shoulders.\n",
        "They were moving more slowly now and the glow of Havana was not so\n",
        "strong, so that he knew the current must be carrying them to the\n",
        "eastward.  If I lose the glare of Havana we must be going more to the\n",
        "eastward, he thought.  For if the fish's course held true I must see it\n",
        "for many more hours.  I wonder how the baseball came out in the grand\n",
        "leagues today, he thought.  It would be wonderful to do this with a\n",
        "radio.  Then he thought, think of it always.  Think of what you are\n",
        "doing.  You must do nothing stupid.\n",
        "\n",
        "Then he said aloud, \"I wish I had the boy.  To help me and to see this.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "No one should be alone in their old age, he thought.  But it is\n",
        "unavoidable.  I must remember to eat the tuna before he spoils in order\n",
        "to keep strong.  Remember, no matter how little you want to, that you\n",
        "must eat him in the morning.  Remember, he said to himself.\n",
        "\n",
        "During the night two porpoise came around the boat and he could hear\n",
        "them rolling and blowing.  He could tell the difference between the\n",
        "blowing noise the male made and the sighing blow of the female.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"They are good,\" he said.  \"They play and make jokes and love one\n",
        "another.  They are our brothers like the flying fish.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Then he began to pity the great fish that he had hooked.  He is\n",
        "wonderful and strange and who knows how old he is, he thought.  Never\n",
        "have I had such a strong fish nor one who acted so strangely.  Perhaps\n",
        "he is too wise to jump.  He could ruin me by jumping or by a wild rush.\n",
        "But perhaps he has been hooked many times before and he knows that this\n",
        "is how he should make his fight.  He cannot know that it is only one\n",
        "man against him, nor that it is an old man.  But what a great fish he\n",
        "is and what he will bring in the market if the flesh is good.  He took\n",
        "the bait like a male and he pulls like a male and his fight has no\n",
        "panic in it.  I wonder if he has any plans or if he is just as\n",
        "desperate as I am?\n",
        "\n",
        "He remembered the time he had hooked one of a pair of marlin.  The male\n",

        "female, made a wild, panic-stricken, despairing fight that soon\n",
        "exhausted her, and all the time the male had stayed with her, crossing\n",
        "the line and circling with her on the surface.  He had stayed so close\n",
        "that the old man was afraid he would cut the line with his tail which\n",
        "was sharp as a scythe and almost of that size and shape.  When the old\n",
        "man had gaffed her and clubbed her, holding the rapier bill with its\n",
        "sandpaper edge and clubbing her across the top of her head until her\n",
        "colour turned to a colour almost like the backing of mirrors, and then,\n",
        "with the boy's aid, hoisted her aboard, the male fish had stayed by the\n",
        "side of the boat.  Then, while the old man was clearing the lines and\n",
        "preparing the harpoon, the male fish jumped high into the air beside\n",
        "the boat to see where the female was and then went down deep, his\n",
        "lavender wings, that were his pectoral fins, spread wide and all his\n",
        "wide lavender stripes showing.  He was beautiful, the old man\n",
        "remembered, and he had stayed.\n",
        "\n",
        "That was the saddest thing I ever saw with them, the old man thought.\n",
        "The boy was sad too and we begged her pardon and butchered her promptly.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"I wish the boy was here,\" he said aloud and settled himself against\n",
        "the rounded planks of the bow and felt the strength of the great fish\n",

        "whatever he had chosen.\n",
        "\n",
        "When once, through my treachery, it had been necessary to him to make a\n",
        "choice, the old man thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "His choice had been to stay in the deep dark water far out beyond all\n",
        "snares and traps and treacheries.  My choice was to go there to find\n",
        "him beyond all people.  Beyond all people in the world.  Now we are\n",
        "joined together and have been since noon.  And no one to help either\n",
        "one of us.\n",
        "\n",
        "Perhaps I should not have been a fisherman, he thought.  But that was\n",
        "the thing that I was born for.  I must surely remember to eat the tuna\n",
        "after it gets light.\n",
        "\n",
        "Some time before daylight something took one of the baits that were\n",
        "behind him.  He heard the stick break and the line begin to rush out\n",
        "over the gunwale of the skiff.  In the darkness he loosened his sheath\n",
        "knife and taking all the strain of the fish on his left shoulder he\n",
        "leaned back and cut the line against the wood of the gunwale.  Then he\n",
        "cut the other line closest to him and in the dark made the loose ends\n",
        "of the reserve coils fast.  He worked skillfully with the one hand and\n",
        "put his foot on the coils to hold them as he drew his knots tight.  Now\n",
        "he had six reserve coils of line.  There were two from each bait he had\n",
        "severed and the two from the bait the fish had taken and they were all\n",
        "connected.\n",
        "\n",
        "After it is light, he thought, I will work back to the forty-fathom\n",
        "bait and cut it away too and link up the reserve coils.  I will have\n",
        "lost two hundred fathoms of good Catalan _cordel_ and the hooks and\n",
        "leaders.  That can be replaced.  But who replaces this fish if I hook\n",
        "some fish and it cuts him off?  I don't know what that fish was that\n",
        "took the bait just now.  It could have been a marlin or a broadbill or\n",
        "a shark.  I never felt him.  I had to get rid of him too fast.\n",
        "\n",
        "Aloud he said, \"I wish I had the boy.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "But you haven't got the boy, he thought.  You have only yourself and\n",
        "you had better work back to the last line now, in the dark or not in\n",
        "the dark, and cut it away and hook up the two reserve coils.\n",
        "\n",
        "So he did it.  It was difficult in the dark and once the fish made a\n",
        "surge that pulled him down on his face and made a cut below his eye.\n",
        "The blood ran down his cheek a little way.  But it coagulated and dried\n",
        "before it reached his chin and he worked his way back to the bow and\n",
        "rested against the wood.  He adjusted the sack and carefully worked the\n",
        "line so that it came across a new part of his shoulders and, holding it\n",
        "anchored with his shoulders, he carefully felt the pull of the fish and\n",
        "then felt with his hand the progress of the skiff through the water.\n",
        "\n",
        "I wonder what he made that lurch for, he thought.  The wire must have\n",
        "slipped on the great hill of his back.  Certainly his back cannot feel\n",
        "as badly as mine does.  But he cannot pull this skiff forever, no\n",
        "matter how great he is.  Now everything is cleared away that might make\n",
        "trouble and I have a big reserve of line; all that a man can ask.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fish,\" he said softly, aloud, \"I'll stay with you until I am dead.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "He'll stay with me too, I suppose, the old man thought and he waited\n",
        "for it to be light.  It was cold now in the time before daylight and he\n",
        "pushed against the wood to be warm.  I can do it as long as he can, he\n",
        "thought.  And in the first light the line extended out and down into\n",
        "the water.  The boat moved steadily and when the first edge of the sun\n",
        "rose it was on the old man's right shoulder.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"He's headed north,\" the old man said.  The current will have set us\n",
        "far to the eastward, he thought.  I wish he would turn with the\n",
        "current.  That would show that he was tiring.\n",
        "\n",
        "When the sun had risen further the old man realized that the fish was\n",
        "not tiring.  There was only one favorable sign.  The slant of the line\n",
        "showed he was swimming at a lesser depth.  That did not necessarily\n",
        "mean that he would jump.  But he might.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"God let him jump,\" the old man said.  \"I have enough line to handle\n",
        "him.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Maybe if I can increase the tension just a little it will hurt him and\n",
        "he will jump, he thought.  Now that it is daylight let him jump so that\n",
        "he'll fill the sacks along his backbone with air and then he cannot go\n",
        "deep to die.\n",
        "\n",
        "He tried to increase the tension, but the line had been taut up to the\n",
        "very edge of the breaking point since he had hooked the fish and he\n",
        "felt the harshness as he leaned back to pull and knew he could put no\n",
        "more strain on it.  I must not jerk it ever, he thought.  Each jerk\n",
        "widens the cut the hook makes and then when he does jump he might throw\n",
        "it.  Anyway I feel better with the sun and for once I do not have to\n",
        "look into it.\n",
        "\n",
        "There was yellow weed on the line but the old man knew that only made\n",
        "an added drag and he was pleased.  It was the yellow Gulf weed that had\n",
        "made so much phosphorescence in the night.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Fish,\" he said, \"I love you and respect you very much.  But I will\n",

        "\n",
        "Let us hope so, he thought.\n",
        "\n",
        "A small bird came toward the skiff from the north.  He was a warbler\n",
        "and flying very low over the water.  The old man could see that he was\n",
        "very tired.\n",
        "\n",
        "The bird made the stern of the boat and rested there.  Then he flew\n",
        "around the old man's head and rested on the line where he was more\n",
        "comfortable.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"How old are you?\" the old man asked the bird.  \"Is this your first\n",

        "I have to have it, I will open it, cost whatever it costs.  But I do\n",
        "not want to open it now by force.  Let it open by itself and come back\n",

        "\n",
        "He looked at the sky and saw the white cumulus built like friendly\n",

        "His left hand was still cramped, but he was unknotting it slowly.\n",
        "\n",
        "I hate a cramp, he thought.  It is a treachery of one's own body.  It\n",
        "is humiliating before others to have a diarrhoea from ptomaine\n",
        "poisoning or to vomit from it.  But a cramp, he thought of it as a\n",

        "were more than a dozen of them and they jumped and kicked like sand\n",
        "fleas.  The old man pinched their heads off with his thumb and\n",

        "very tiny but he knew they were nourishing and they tasted good.\n",
        "\n",
        "The old man still had two drinks of water in the bottle and he used\n",

        "\n",
        "Now he knew there was the fish and his hands and back were no dream.\n",

        "\n",

        "enough cirrus above them so that the old man knew the breeze would last\n",
        "all night.  The old man looked at the fish constantly to make sure it\n",
        "was true.  It was an hour before the first shark hit him.\n",
        "\n",
        "The shark was not an accident.  He had come up from deep down in the\n",
        "water as the dark cloud of blood had settled and dispersed in the mile\n",
        "deep sea.  He had come up so fast and absolutely without caution that\n",
        "he broke the surface of the blue water and was in the sun.  Then he\n",
        "fell back into the sea and picked up the scent and started swimming on\n",
        "the course the skiff and the fish had taken.\n",
        "\n",
        "Sometimes he lost the scent.  But he would pick it up again, or have\n",
        "just a trace of it, and he swam fast and hard on the course.  He was a\n",
        "very big Mako shark built to swim as fast as the fastest fish in the\n",
        "sea and everything about him was beautiful except his jaws.\n",
        "\n",
        "His back was as blue as a sword fish's and his belly was silver and his\n",
        "hide was smooth and handsome.  He was built as a sword fish except for\n",

        "the fingers of the old man and they had razor-sharp cutting edges on\n",

        "as he drove forward in the meat just above the tail.  The shark's head\n",
        "was out of water and his back was coming out and the old man could hear\n",

        "Then, on his back, with his tail lashing and his jaws clicking, the\n",

        "\n",
        "\"You think too much, old man,\" he said aloud.\n",

        "the highest price in the market.  But there was no way to keep its\n",

        "the fish.  He clubbed at heads and heard the jaws chop and the shaking\n",

        "\n",
        "He knew he was beaten now finally and without remedy and he went back\n",
        "to the stern and found the jagged end of the tiller would fit in the\n",
        "slot of the rudder well enough for him to steer.  He settled the sack\n",
        "around his shoulders and put the skiff on her course.  He sailed\n",
        "lightly now and he had no thoughts nor any feelings of any kind.  He\n",
        "was past everything now and he sailed the skiff to make his home port\n",
        "as well and as intelligently as he could.  In the night sharks hit the\n",
        "carcass as someone might pick up crumbs from the table.  The old man\n",
        "paid no attention to them and did not pay any attention to anything\n",

        "thought.  Bed is my friend.  Just bed, he thought.  Bed will be a great\n",
        "thing.  It is easy when you are beaten, he thought.  I never knew how\n",
        "easy it was.  And what beat you, he thought.\n",

        "sailed up onto the little patch of shingle below the rocks.  There was\n",
        "no one to help him so he pulled the boat up as far as he could.  Then\n",
        "he stepped out and made her fast to a rock.\n",
        "\n",

        "saw in the reflection from the street light the great tail of the fish\n",
        "standing up well behind the skiff's stern.  He saw the white naked line\n",

        "and all the nakedness between.\n",
        "\n",
        "He started to climb again and at the top he fell and lay for some time\n",

        "difficult and he sat there with the mast on his shoulder and looked at\n",
        "the road.  A cat passed on the far side going about its business and\n",
        "the old man watched it.  Then he just watched the road.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally he put the mast down and stood up.  He picked the mast up and\n",

        "\n",
        "Inside the shack he leaned the mast against the wall.  In the dark he\n",
